# Music-Player-
How about building your personal music player? This really sounds exciting to me. Create and build not just any other music app but also aa app which searches through files and explores your program directories in search of music. Build an interactive interface to be used by other users as well. 

Consider adding features like browsing through tracks, volume control, song/artist/ album/ movie display, database management, algorithm construction, and data processing to develop a fully-featured interactive app.
